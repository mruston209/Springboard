## Capstone 2 - NFL Daily Fantasy Project

The motivation for this project was that I was active on FanDuel during the football season.
Daily fantasy sports can be a lot of fun! Can data science help me construct winning lineups?

### 1. Background on NFL daily fantasy contests
FanDuel has different ways of gambling on sports. One way is DFS (daily fantasy sports) where one chooses a roster of players.
You then win money if your chosen lineup scores enough points compared to other people's lineups.

Example: 10/17/21 was a Sunday, and week 6 of of the 2021 NFL season.
FanDuel had the following contest: "$30K Sun NFL Pooch Punt (150 Entries Max)"
Each lineup entry fee was $0.05. The total size of the entry pool was 658,727 entries!
I entered 4 different lineups for that contest. Here's one example entry:
